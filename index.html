        <h2 class="h2">Hello! I am Earth</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
          object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a water
          world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface
          water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean,
          covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust
          is land, most of which is located in the form of continental
          landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. <br />
          <br />
          Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation,
          while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water
          than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water
          combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates,
          which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.
          Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable
          of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic
          radiation.

        <div class="background first">
          <h2 class="h21">Formation</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and
          outgassing.[43] Water vapor from these sources condensed into the
          oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and
          comets.[44] Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth
          since it formed.[45] In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept
          the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of
          its current luminosity.[46] By 3.5 Ga, Earth's magnetic field was
          established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped
          away by the solar wind. <br />
          <br />
          As the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it formed the first solid
          crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition. The first
          continental crust, which was more felsic in composition, formed by the
          partial melting of this mafic crust.
        </p>

        <div class="background second">
          <h2 class="h21">Future</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the
          next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and
          over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%.[78] Earth's increasing surface
          temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO2
          concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4
          photosynthesis) in approximately 100–900 million years.[79][80] The
          lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the
          atmosphere, making animal life impossible. <br />
          <br />
          Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach
          100 °C (212 °F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will
          evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse
          effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years.[82] Even if the
          Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will
          descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean
          ridges.

        <div class="background third">
          <h2 class="h21">Surface</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Earth's surface is the boundary between the atmosphere, and the solid
          Earth and oceans. Defined in this way, it has an area of about 510
          million km2 (197 million sq mi).[12] Earth can be divided into two
          hemispheres: by latitude into the polar Northern and Southern
          hemispheres; or by longitude into the continental Eastern and Western
          hemispheres. <br />
          <br />
          in Earth's early history the ocean may have covered Earth
          completely.[103] The world ocean is commonly divided into the Pacific
          Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Antarctic or Southern Ocean, and
          Arctic Ocean, from largest to smallest. The ocean covers Earth's
          oceanic crust, with the shelf seas covering the shelves of the
          continental crust to a lesser extent.
